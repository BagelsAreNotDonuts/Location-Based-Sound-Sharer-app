# Overview

The first part of the UQ's COMU2140's "cross platform project".

The web app uses a number of react frameworks, like tone.js to allow the user to create short, layered instrument sound samples and upload them to a database, assigned with a location on UQ campus.

The work done here is solely front-end, the apis called were provided by the course coordinators.

The second part of the project involved a react native app, which integrated a map and detected the uploaded sound samples at their respective locations, allowing users to play them back.
